I am sure it is in another one of your videos , and I was hoping you can tell me which one : you mentioned about confidence at the end . so , how to you resolve the STRENGTH of your confidence ? for example , you may put criteria to the number of values in a node say ( 10 or more ) , but one with 7 and 3 in one node (70%) is likely not as confident as one with say ( , 68 and 32). 68%. in other words , I would think there is some kind of a hypothesis test that declares how confident one is in a nodes statement .

"Great video ! It cleared a lot of stuff up . I am using this video as a reference in implementing classification trees eventualy ( hoping to work my way up to forests ) from scratch in python . One question I have is , the algorithm presented in the video seems to check every possible option per split , and for the continuous case the number of possible things you need to test scale with the amount of data points that the tree is being fitted on though ( you probab ily do not need to test the average between every pair of data points when the amount of data is sufficiently large ) . I have not done a time complexity analysis , but I feel like as the number of features and data points increase , the tree will take a LOT more time to fit to the data even ( if you define a max depth hyperparameter ) . Are there any tricks techniques / you can point me to that would reduce the computation needed to make the tree and or / whether these concerns are even valid ?",knowledgedistiller,UCr2hil0HlsLynXThtzq08-g,"Decision and Classification Trees, Clearly Explained!!!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L39rN6gz7Y

I am seeing everywhere people doing the usual sci kit learn train test , modelling predictions and checking of the a curacy , but I do not see anywhere of people actually in puting one row of the data and seeing whether the person should be approved of a loan or not .

"Helo . Nice explanation . Could you please send along the data set you used for the Use Case ? Also , I have a couple questions about the disadvantages of a decision tre . You say that the decision tree is high variance and low bias at ( 9:02 minutes into the presentation ) . #1. I am not sure why low bias is a disadvantage . Why is that ? #2. I assume that the closer the decision tree gets to zero entropy ie ( . . each leaf contains only one class of data ) , the higher the variance and the lower the bias . Is that corect ? #3. I guess that the art of building a decision tree is finding the best sequence of splitting criteria to employ , and knowing when to stop spliting . I guess you can always continue to split until you reach zero entropy , but toward the end of that process you are just learning noise over fit ing ( ) . I assume that choosing the best "" "" sequence of splitting criteria essentially determines how soon you start learning noise . Please comment on these three questions if you would .

As usual all your videos are mind blowing . No doubt on it . In this Video you mentioned that machine learning understands only numbers . Hence if any labels characters / are there in inputs we may have to convert inputs to numbers and so Label Encoder is used .

"Well done Sir . Please I have a challenge to solve this question . Mr Intelligent / IT Ok is graduating from high school this year and he must decide first what college to attend and then what course of Study to pursue . He has narrowed his choice to two university . He has been admitted at UI . and his town University , Bowen . In addition to choosing between University , Mr Intelligence must decide whether to major in Engineering or busines . Because of the nature of the schol s , Mr Intelligence has a different probability of Success ie . different chances of graduating , depending on which University he attends and which field he majors in . If he goes to UI . and choses Business his prob . of Success is 0.6 while Engineering in UI . is 0.7. If he goes to Bowen and choses Business his prob . of success is 0.9. If he goes to Bowen to study Engineering the prob . of success is 0.95. A UI . graduate in Business earns per month , a UI . graduate In Engineering earns per month . If it is Bowen graduate in Business is and Bowen Engineering is per month . If Mr Intelligent does not graduate he earns ! per month .

I noticed after plotting the tree that out of 10 features or predictors , the tree uses only 5 predictors to build the tre . This is without tuning any parameters . So my question is in general what are the reasons for the tree not to include all features ? My second question is : I often use the prediction contribution method from XG BOST to calculate the prediction of each individual features . Could you therefore kindly make a video feature prediction contribution OR shapley values to clear this concept in near future ? thank you !",fuad hasan,UCpdXSb-3nq3Bx9XHyY9s5fw,"Regression Trees, Clearly Explained!!!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9c66TUylZ4

"In the last section , the tree with multiple variable , after choosing age as the root of the tree you put dosage as next internal node in the right , I understand that it is because the RSS value is lower than sex , but why you put dosage >= 29 instead of 14.5 like in one variable tre ? If it is because dosage >= 29 is the same first internal node as in the one variable tree (14.5 is the rot ) then basically we need to grow a full one variable tree for all predictors , because we do not know which one of the internal node in the particular one variable tree will be used in internal node of multi variable tre , it can be the last internal node or maybe the rd3 or th6 internal node . or it is because of another calculation , maybe like finding new dosage threshold by finding new lowest RSS value among all samples in dosage predictor but limited to samples that have age value < 50? actually I have found your answer in the comments section , but you are only answering because "" this time the data have already been split based on age ."", but I still do not get it , it is still does not clear to me , like if you are not growing one variable tree with dosage predictor before , you will not suddenly put dosage >= 29 in the internal node on right side , right ? then in other words either you need to growing the one variable tree first before growing multi variable tree or you are finding dosage threshold on the fly when you are growing multi variable tree",CBagus JK,UCjVvbcTScVzp2bHU4qh6aEw,"Regression Trees, Clearly Explained!!!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9c66TUylZ4

I have one question from the video when using dosage as the single predictor the initial node threshold was dosage <14.5, whereas when using multiple predictors , age >50 was the initial node followed by node dosage >=29. Is the reason dosage 29 was used instead of 14.5 because dosage 29 was a better subsequent split than 14.5 among those younger than 50?

One suggestion that I have is in the first part of the video , where you are performing regression with a single predictor variable , you demonstrated that the SAME predictor variable can be used to form a binary partition multiple times . In the second half of the video , you did an example with multiple regression using multiple predictor variables . However , in this example , it appears that the partitioning uses each variable once . I believe that you can use the same variable to make multiple splits as you did in the single predictor variable case .

"Hello Sir , I would like to ask that , when multiple predictors are being used , we calculate SR for each predictor , but when we choose the Root node , and subsequent nodes , why does the value of Node that we had selected for Age and Sex change ? Like at 20:16 we see that Dosage is at 14.5, but once the Age is selected as root node , at 20:40, the Dosage node is compared to 29. When the SR initially calculated was low at 14.5, then how can we select 29 as the new value to make decision ? Although the entire explanation was superb , but I am confused here , and hope that you would resolve it for me :)",Gursahaj Bir Singh Kohli,UCNu49LSEjr7WkoAi4XDTFyw,"Regression Trees, Clearly Explained!!!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9c66TUylZ4

Few ideas : traveling salesman problem , generating photos while emulating analog artefacts or simple ranking of new dishes I would like to try based on my restaurants ' order history . Even answering with the relevant links terminology / would be fantastic .

"Hi Krish , I appreciate the video . Can I confirm whether the graph that you drew for Gini Impurity changes as the number of classes increases ? Ie if you have 4 classes and a node in which each class was 25% then your GI formula is 1 ((.25^2)+(.25^2)+(.25^2)+(.25^2)) = 1 .25 =.75. Conversely , if you had 50%, 25% and 25% in a node with 4 classes you get a GI of .625. In this situation the greater data messiness is when each classification is p*=.25 rather than .5 as in your binary example . Accordingly I would expect the graph to peak earlier . Are there any rules to become aware of as number of classes increase ?",Marcus Wimalajeewa,UCDTbQBhtZ6f_bcsVWrQcgQw,Tutorial 39- Gini Impurity Intuition In Depth In Decision Tree,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aIFgrrTqOw

"Hello Dr . Rai , thank you for a very informative video . One thing that I would like to add based on my limited knowledge : For a skewed class distribution such as in the data , it is more importance that the model is able to predict the abnormal cases then it is to predict normal cases . If we just look at the mis classification er or , then the model may be aligned towards the class with higher percentage of data . One way to avoid that is to reduce the disparity between the class types by over under / sampling techniques . Another way is to use the Area under the precision recall curve as a measure of model evaluation . Your comments and feedback on this would be apreciated .",Umair,UCEuXxnGFSp9GUp3y-s3jNkw,Decision Tree with R | Complete Example,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU3Adlru1Ng

"Thanks for taking on the XG Bost algorithm , K√°roly . I was quite excited to see you try to explain the XG Bost algorithm , because I a( machine learning researcher ) have had difficulty understanding their methods . However , I have an issue with this video . You really only described Random Forests at a high level in this video , and did not touch on gradient boosting and much less extreme gradient boosting XG Bost ( ) . I fear that without that disclaimer , our fellow scholars may be misled into thinking that XG Bost works like Random Forests , which is certainly not the case .

"Hello . I am facing a problem in Machine learning a sign ment . Here is a question . Part 1 is resolved . Please help me out in the second part . Please do it AS SOON AS POSIBLE . If anyone know this problem kindly reply . Thank you a) You are given a dataset for cancer detection having two classes binary ( clas ification ) . 0 stands for ‚Äúcancer not detected ‚Äù and 1 for ‚Äúcancer detected ‚Äù . This dataset has train test / split . Training set has 1 0,0 instances records / where half of the instances belong to class 0 and remaining half belong to class 1. Testing set has 1,0 instances where 90 instances belong to class 0 and 10 instances belong to class 1. You create two models , model A and model B. Model A gives you training accuracy of 80% and testing accuracy of 75%. Model B gives you training accuracy of 50% but testing accuracy of 9%. Between these two , which model will you prefer and why ? Discuss potential problems in both models and method how to rectify them . b) You create another model C which has low bias ie . is elastic enough to mimic the training data distribution .

"My instinct in trying to use my human intelligence to predict if John will play tennis is to look at other factors that might be at play . I assumed that the days in question were consecutive . I immediately thought about the possibility that John might be basing his decision to play Tennis on the days of the we ok . Playing mostly on weekdays and resting on we ok ends . He seems to rest on Sundays so I would guess he will not play on Day 15.

Good explanation . But correction ned ed . Gini oscillates between 0 and 0.5. The worst split could half positive half negative . Gini impurity for that wing is 0.5 also overall weighted gini would be 0.5.

"Is this an example of that common is "" "" versus contains "" "" misconception from the set theory ? As in , neural networks contain * * decision trees the ( former are a superset of the later ) , but are not * * decision trees themselves ? My point ? Yes , one should be able to turn a neural network into a unique ( ) decision tre , by the method described in the video , but . can one turn a decision tree into a unique ( ) neural network ? Obviously , one can train a neural network on any specified decision tre , but . one can actually describe exactly the same decision tree with theoretical y ( ) infinite number of neural networks each ( of them also * * describing a number of other * * decision tres , at the same time ) . No , I definitely would not say that neural networks are * * decision tres . They do contain * * decision tres , though , and that is to be expected , following that . Neural networks are general * * function * * a proxima to rs * * and decision trees are functions , alright . I can see why one would want to equate neural networks with decision tres , though . Decision trees are easy to keep contained within specified decision ( ) boundaries , and neural networks are anything but easy to contain within ( desired decision boundaries ) . But , at best , one will only be able to predict that an AI neural ( network ) will kill everybody with some low ( , but always non zero in the case of really complex , real world AI systems ) probability , which definitely will not solve the problem of preventing with ( 10% probability ) that AI from killing everybody at some point . Unfortunately or ( fortunately , depends on one's point of view ) , I do not think that this is the right approach to AGI ( ) safety other ( than computing failures you ces / probabilities . including catastrophic ones ) , which , I am a sum ing , is what this paper is really all about , right ?",Ed Corns,UCgW3zVUEOZNxeOBabhFQLdg,Neural Networks are Decision Trees (w/ Alexander Mattick),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_okxGdHM5b8

Decision trees are particularly amenable to this sort of analysis since a bit can be considered a decision .
