"I have done a regression analysis on a dataset , but due to the way the data is , one of the variable is getting a negative coefficient in the final equation . Eg . Y = a X1 b X2 . But I know for sure that the variable X2 has a positive effect on Y. So , my question is : What to do when your regression or correlation analysis gives you a coefficient which is either of opposite sign or of low magnitude but you theoretically know that for sure the variable has a positive and a strong influence please . help",rishi kulshrestha,UC_7jQczxWUjVcuypXkaZ9Ew,An Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPG4NjIkCjc

"A small comment at 17:35. I guess it is Derivative of Jm ( ) over m. In other words , the rate of change of Jm ( ) over a minute change of m. That gives us the slope at instantaneous points , especially for non linear curves when slope is not constant . At each point of m"", Jm ( ) "" , Gradient descent travels in the opposite direction of slope to find the Global minima , with the smaller learning rate . Please correct me if I am missing something .

If we have already calculated the cost function J at multiple values of m, then why do we need to do gradient descent because we already know the m where J is minimum 3. So we start with an m , calculate grad J ( ) at that point and update m with m' = m grad J ( ) * learn rate and repeat till we reach some convergence criteria Please let me know if my understanding is corect .",Amit Srivastava,UC_TGl723JsYbmgU7LRidgBA,Tutorial 26- Linear Regression Indepth Maths Intuition- Data Science,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-OGRohmH2s

"Hi Josh , I would like to confirm clarify / a couple of things : 1. Are the be tasco efic I ents / the mean values of the independent variable 2. When we run the regression on multiple variables then you would notice that along with each variable a standard error is given . How is that calculated 3. To test the significance of a variable why do we need a t statistic z / statistic . Why ca not we work with absolute numbers . In case pf zt / statistic are we not transforming it to a different scale co / ordinated plane . Then why ca not we work with the absolute numbers . And if we do work with absolute numbers then how do we deduce if the variable is significant or not because then z statistic t / statistic will not work . Please correct me if I am wrong , the aim with t z/ statistic is to transform the observed sample mean of an independent variable to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 and then make sure the transformed mean is significantly different from 0 because of the coefficient is 0 then the variable holds no importance in the model",Harpreet Kaur,UCeLZVBQ6f5d8aQEdvFuNJlw,"Linear Regression, Clearly Explained!!!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2CQITm_eo

"7:20 what Are ^ 2 means How much of the variance in the y data can be explained by taking the x data into a count . Taking the x data into account here means shifting the line around which we measure the variance from just being a flat line in the middle of the y data to being the regression line with respect to x data . Are ^ 2 = variance ( around flat line variance around regression line ) / variance around flat line The higher Are ^ 2 is , means the variance around the regression line is lower and we have a better fit stronger correlation between the variables 12:20 predicting variable based on two variables instead of one . Two variables on the z and x axis , the prediction is the y axis . In this case we fit a plane to the data not a line . The plane has 3 parameters . 13:30 we fit a plane 14:20 if the tail length variable in the z axis is n ’ t useful doesn ’ t ( give a higher Are ^ 2 ) then the least squares method will give it a coefficient of 0. Equations with more parameters won ’ t make the sum of squares around the fit worse than an equation with fewer parameters . Least squares will make parameters that make Are ^ 2 around the fit worse have 0 coef I cient . So having more parameters won ’ t make our are ^ 2 worse , but it could make it better due to random chance . Without ( there actually being a co relation ) 15:50 we report an adjusted Are ^ 2 that scales Are ^ 2 by the number of params in the model 16:0 Are ^ 2 needs a p value To do : Continue is A",Mostafa,UCWuZKn61GpvZCpqf9QffwpQ,"Linear Regression, Clearly Explained!!!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2CQITm_eo

In typical NHS T , if we got a significant p value , we would say something like given "" our null hypothesis is true , this is the probability that we would observe a result at least as rare as the observed result , and because it is is less than some significance level , we reject our null hypothesis and make the claim that we think that this result does not come from the distribution specified by the null hypothesis , though we realize this claim may be a false positive with value equal to our p value .

"This question is not specifically on this video but it is somewhat related . Why do I feel that there is a difference between the way regression is taught in a statistics class and machine learning clas ? Typical y , all statistics classes online and 1 of line course I have taken explain the regression using normal form solution of least square . They further get into significance and diagnostics of residuals , leverage points etc . There is some emphasis on assumptions like errors being distributed normally etc . On the other hand , machine learnings usualy ( CS ) courses talk about gradient descent algorithm instead of normal form solution . The focus is solely on prediction without caring much about diagnostics ?

"1 Question A researcher is investigating a possible effect of Face bok use on exam grades and he wants to try a linear regression model . He has outside data , collected via a survey , showing that the correlation between the student ’ s exam grade and the number of hours spent on Face bok in the days before the exam is about 0.12. If the researcher wanted to use linear regression to predict the exam score for a student who spent 6 hours on Face bok before his exam , which is of the following best describes the researcher ’ s situation ? He 1 . should use linear regression since the correlation coefficient is not 0 it is clear that there is a linear relationship between the two variables . He 2 . should use linear reg resi on . Because of the negative co relation , spending more time on Face bok leads to lower exam scores . He 3 . should use linear reg resi on . He can predict the exam score for a student who spent 6 hours on Face bok before the exam using the equation score = 1 00 + 6 × −(0.12). He 4 . should not use linear regression because the correlation is not strong enough . He 5 . needs to plot the data eg ( . . a s cater plot ) before deciding whether to use linear reg resi on . Question 3 . Which of the following is false ? A1. data point that has a negative residual is located below the regression line . The 2 . variability of residuals should increase as x increases . Residuals 3 . of linear models should be distributed nearly normally around 0. The 4 . residuals plot residuals ( versus . x) should show a random scatter around 0. Question . 5 For a certain professional basketball team , 32% of the variability in the team ’ s points scored per game is explained by the total salary of the opposing team . For this particular team , which of the following could be the correlation between their points scored per game and the salary of the opposing team ? 1. −−0.32=0.102 2. −−−−−√−0.32=0.56 3. −10.32=0.98 4. −−−−−√10.32=0.434 Question 6 . 6 A student is studying the relationship between how much money students spend on food and on entertainment per we ok . Based on a sample size of 270, he calculates a correlation coefficient of 0.0 1 3 for these two variables . Which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation ? This 1 . low correlation of 0.0 1 3 indicates there is no relationship . There 2 . is no linear relationship but there may be a nonlinear relationship . This 3 . correlation indicates a definite strong nonlinear relationship . This 4 . correlation indicates there is a strong linear relationship . 8. Question 8 Which of the following best describes ST sum ( of squares total ) in a reg resi on ? Strength of the model fit . 1 Total variability in the explanatory variable . 2 Total variability in the response variable . 3 Explained variability in the response variable . 4 Unexplained variability in the response variable . 1 point",Rizwan Shoukat,UCM-FUrUbxVADt-8ujJ9sQMw,"Linear Regression, Clearly Explained!!!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2CQITm_eo

Josh you give great explanations of what Are ^ 2 means intuitively . Now you can obtain Are ^ 2 by squaring the correlation coefficient Are ? These two formulas look completely diferent . Your formula has only the dependent variable y; most formulas I see with Are have both independant and dependent variables . For instance are = n1 / ( sum 1 ) * Zx Zy or are sum xi = ( x bary I ) ( y bar sqrt sum xi ) / ( ( ( x bar sqrt sumy I ) ^ 2 ) * ( ( ( y bar ) ^ 2 ) ) ) . Would it involve some tricky math to show how these two equations are related ? They seem to be measuring different things Are measures the correlations among the data points and Are ^ 2 measures the difference of the variation of the mean and fit divided by variation of the mean . How can these two variables be related ?,Marvalisa Payne,UCbDEOy5h4Dd1xGv-RUJ8LQg,"Linear Regression, Clearly Explained!!!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2CQITm_eo

What if you get F values distribution by taking samples of data which is say a normal distribution with a mean around 6. Then finding 6 as the F value for fitting the original data is not uncommon and hence the p value is large .

"For some reason I have never been able to understand the two equations for Are squared that I find in text boks online / . I have seen ones like the one you present here var mean ( ( ) var fit var mean ( ) ) / ( ( ) ) but then I also see 1 S residuals S total ( ) / ( ) . It is most likely my bad algebra that is preventing me from seeing how the two equations are the same . Any chance you explain how the two equations are actually the same thing Here's ? my a tempt ! So the st 1 definition tells us how much our 'best fit ' line whose ( parameters were acquired by minimizing the sum of squared er or s improves ) the variance of predictions in ( percent terms ) ? The nd2 definition , however , says take 10% (1 = 10/10=10%) of the sum of squares using the mean of our data the ( S total our naive model ) , then subtract from that the ratio sum of squared errors of our best fit and the total sum of squared errors from the mean . The difference between these numbers tells us . and this is where my understanding breaks down . Why ca not we just say Sres S to t / is the explained variation ?

A big mistake universities make , they put lecturers to teach Stats and other subjects for which a lecture is just the wrong and ( cheap ) aproach . These subjects need to be 'taught'. That is a big difference between teachers and lecturers . Teachers approach a subject with learners in mind and make learning a shared journey . Lecturers lecture they do not care whether you are learning anything at all as their job is to just talk away a very easy job . Your work is amazing !

"Hi Brandon ! I am not usually one to leave comments on You Tube videos that I watch ; however , I must express my sincere gratitude . I am an online college student . I have had some ups and downs with learning the basics of statistics , but my desire to comprehend drove me on . I sort of felt like I hit a wall when it came to linear regression and my textbook has not been of much help . For statistics , I need teaching videos that are EXACTLY like what you have created here . Yesterday , I felt led to try finding an easy to understand video concerning linear reg resi on . No matter what the subject matter is , I need to be able to grasp the most basic of concepts before more is built on top of that . I am so glad that I typed statistics "" linear regression easy explanation "" and clicked on your channel first . I really appreciated your introduction . Everything you said in it resonated with me . The crazy thing is that I am thinking of watching some of your other videos on math and statistics , even though I typically do not have the desire to engage with it if I do not have to . I am reminded once again that the best teachers are those who can break down a concept skillfully so even a person with zero prior knowledge can understand . I am thinking of watching more of your videos , not just because they are required for a class etc , but because it may be interesting and even FUN to learn with your videos ! This is the first video of yours that I have watched , but here are some of my favorite things that I am seeing thus far : * Slower explanations : This is HUGE . I love when teachers take the time to explain the bits and pieces . * Visual charts and to ls : I feel like this is how humans are designed to learn . * Implementing a real world example : Just by using a simple real world situation that most of us can understand tip ing ( ) , it felt easier to track with you because whenever certain terminology like variables and formulas equations / a pear , I find myself wanting to connect abstract concepts to something that I am already familar with . * Quick Review : I think that every teacher should include this . Please continue to include these . I ca not remember the last time I left a You Tube comment this long . Blessing you and your chanel ! I hope that other students find it =)",Justin #Bride Tribe,UCQ2FkR6B2UhJ1mmr4kfJQpQ,"Statistics 101: Linear Regression, The Very Basics 📈",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjP5RJLQF4

Almost everyone who can read this right now has the ability to be good at math with time , effort and most importantly , good instruction . Thank you for making math accessible and enjoyable .

"Great video ! But I still have a question about why we square the residuals . Squaring seems arbitrary . The video says that it is a) so that all the negative residuals become positive , and b) to emphasise the bigger residuals . Those are good answers . But why do we square them particularly , as opposed to raising them to the th 4 power ? Or the th6 ? Or to the power of any even number ? All these answers would give you positive residuals and emphasise the bigger numbers , which means that squaring the residuals is a bit arbitrary . I would not mind this ordinarily . Hey , it all works , right ? But maths is not supposed to be arbitrary . And if the whole subject of statistics and even machine learning is based on squaring residuals , might we come up with different answers if we raise to a different power ? Thanks for posting the video . Without your clear explanation , I would not have thought of these questions .",Durand Sinclair,UCZ74Xa5k71tq8RNboeoqExg,"Statistics 101: Linear Regression, The Very Basics 📈",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjP5RJLQF4

I have read s1 0 of scientific studies , and am now struggling with how to interpret the results . I trust the authors ' discussion that ( there are positive or significant co relations , relationships ) but do not know how to translate results into scholarly writing that I can understand myself in order to defend it for ( example , how do you present in percentages the significant positive relationship between engaging in after work activities and increased vigor in a population of burned out employees z( =3.39, p < .01)? ) I am a tactile learner , so your examples and graphs have helped me a lot .

"Dear Mr . Foltz , You have done an excellent job explaining a relatively complicated topic . Your teaching style , including the pace at which you explain , is perfect ! Those of us who need to understand new concepts benefit from educators who actually slow the pace at which they teach . Many speak quite fast , as if assuming that we know the concepts . We would not have the need to view educational videos such as your if this were the case ! Arguably , the majority of people if not most learn from excellent educators who realize they need to teach in a clear , slower pace . Clearly , you seem to understand this notion very well : ) I give your teaching style a 9.9, hands down ! Thank you for taking the time to create and to share these valuable videos .

"Fantastic Video . And thanks for doing such a good work on this topic . I do have a question though . Have you or will you ever create a video in which you will discuss the linear regression methodology in solving a real world problem . The steps taken in that on lets say a real data which ( can be derived from a variety of online sources ) . It that can be done that it will be great , because then your explaining the theory and followed by a real Case Study , will go long distance understanding the whole process of Statistical Modeling . Because the real world data is not always numerical which ( is the primary consideration of Linear Reg resi on . ) Thanks for uploading this video Chers .",Vineet Bhardwaz,UCdUpjNBIVB7HcXF7zPw50hg,"Statistics 101: Linear Regression, The Very Basics 📈",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjP5RJLQF4

Some unnecessarily confusing parts : It would have been helpful to explain that our zero coefficient line IS the line y'y= hat ' . The point referred to at 7:05 is not highlighted or pointed out and ( as it sits far above its distance for SR it is not instantly recognizable as conected ) . Positioning of the equations at 8:50 gives strong and erroneous implication that each refers specifically to the diagram above . The equation given for F statistic at 8:58 is then instantly revised as not being corect .

The "" regression line is the one straight line that minimizes the sum of the squared distances of each point to the line "" (3:50) can be slightly misleading .
